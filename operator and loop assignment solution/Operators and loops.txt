Assignment solution questions with answers


1. What are the Conditional Operators in Java?  
Ans: Conditional operators check the condition and decide the desired result on the basis of both conditions.It always returns a boolean value like true or false.


Types of conditional operators :-
a.Conditional AND :- &&
b.Conditional OR :-    ||
c.Ternary Operator :- ?:


a.Conditional AND( && ):-The operator is applied b/w two boolean expressions.It is denoted by the two AND operators (&&) .It returns true if and only if both expressions are true ,else return false.Shown below the table how to work logical AND operator :-


Condition_1
	Condition_2
	Return(true,false)
	1
	1
	true
	1
	0
	false
	 
Systex:-
if(condition_1 && condition_2){
Statements;
}


b.Conditional OR( || ):-The operator is applied b/w two boolean expressions.It is denoted by the two OR operators ( || ) .It returns true, if any one value true ,else return false.Shown below the table how to work logical OR operator :-




            condition_1
	condition_2
	      Return(true,false)
	1
	0
	true
	1
	1
	true
	0
	0
	false
	Syntax:-
if(condition_1 || condition_2){
Statements;
}


c.Ternary operator( ?: ) :- It is a smaller version for the if-else statement.if the statement is true then statement_1 will execute else statement_2 .


Syntax:-
Conditions ? statement_1:statement_2;


2. What are the types of operators based on the number of operands?
Ans: There are three types of operators in Java based on the number of operands. i.e :-
a. Unary operator
b.Binary operator
c.Ternary operator


3. What is the use of Switch case in Java programming? 
Ans: switch statement in Java to execute a particular code block when a certain condition is met.Above ,the expression in the switch parenthesis is compared to each case. When the expression is the same as the case , the corresponding code block in the case gets executed.And break the loop to exit by using break keyword.


Syntax:-
switch (new Date().getDay()) {
  case 0:
    day = "Sunday";
    break;
  case 1:
    day = "Monday";
    break;
  case 2:
     day = "Tuesday";
    break;
  case 3:
    day = "Wednesday";
    break;
  case 4:
    day = "Thursday";
    break;
  case 5:
    day = "Friday";
    break;
  case 6:
    day = "Saturday";
}
	





4. What are the priority levels of arithmetic operation in Java?
Ans: There are two priorities of arithmetic operation in java.Such as :-


1. High priorities :
First priority multiplication(*)
Second priority division(/)
Third priority mudollow(%)


      b.Low priorities:
         First priority addition (+)
         Second priority division (-)


5. What are the conditional Statements and use of conditional statements in Java?
Ans: conditional statements are used to make decisions based on certain conditions. 
The most common conditional statements in java are the if-else statement,the Switch statement, and the Ternary operator.
 If i want to execute a particular block of code in this case we will apply the condition under if -else block.


6. What is the syntax of if else statement?
Ans: The syntax of if else statement are-


if(conditions){
Statements
}
Else if(conditions){
Statements
}
Else{
Statements }
Shown above syntax of if else statement there are three block of code 
If :- condition will true the entire statement will execute otherwise go to else if part.


 Else if:- first check condition ,if condition is true then entire statement will execute otherwise go to next part.


Else:- above both statements are not executed in this case else block of code will be executed .




7. What are the 3 types of iterative statements in java?
Ans: Three types of iterative statements in Java are :


a.for loop 
b.while loop
c.do-while loop




8. Difference Between for loop and do while loop
Ans: There are many difference between for loop and while loop shown below the difference table:-


For loop :-


a .Statement is executed once the condition is checked.
b.if condition is false then can’t be executed.
c.for loop is entry control loop.
d.for(initialization;condition;iteration){
Statement
}




Do while loop :- 
a.condition is checked after the statement is executed.
b.At least once executed if condition is false.
c.do while loop is an exit control loop.
d.do{statements}while(conditions);


9. Write a program to print numbers from 1 to 10.
Ans: i am using for loop to print 1 to 10 :
Public class PrintNumber
{
        Public static void main(String[] args)
       {


                     for(int i=1;i<=10;i++){
                     System.out.print( i+” ”);
                      }
        }
}
